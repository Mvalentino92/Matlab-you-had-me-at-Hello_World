# Matlab_YouHadMeAt_HelloWorld
Collection of functions I wrote and used for my first Computational Mathematics courses. 

Ahh, Matlab. Where do I begin? You were the first language I was exposed to and learned. 
What a warm welcome into the world of Numerical Mathematics you provided.

Most of these functions were written strictly for coursework (in the form of labs), but some I wrote for sport/practice.

Dont take the organization to heart, as these scripts suffered much abuse during classtime and beyond. 
Yet they did their justice for me, and serve as stepping stones for my future aspirations.
